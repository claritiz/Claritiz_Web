  It all starts with an idea, which moves on to a strategy, and eventually
  reaching the stage of a prototype, ensuring maximum cost efficiency, and a
  perfect market fit. 

  It's always best to have an initial development stage that includes
  prototyping and an MVP

In only 5 days to 2 weeks, Our Innovation Workshop simplifies the design process of a digital product.

During the sprint, you rapidly progress from problem to tested solution.The design sprint allows you to solve any design problem.

Helps in answering critical business questions through design, rapid design prototyping, and testing ideas. The process is as follows:



## Prototyping

Between the idea, and the MVP, you have the prototype.

Prototypes are perfect for numerous iterative designs and development, being simpler than an MVP.



## Identify Key Functionality Features

The first step of prototyping is to identify the key / right features of your app.



## Create User Personas

Categorizing User Personas helps in deciding better UI and functionality features for your app.



## Designing the Primary Screens

Design Sketches can be used to get buy-ins from stakeholders before moving forward with the complete development of your app.



## Wireframes

Turn the Design sketches Into Wireframes, a low-fidelity representation of the UI.



## Create the Prototype

Wireframes are then transformed into a prototype by adding basic functionality and interactivity.

A prototype will help you calibrate the UI and improve the user journey.

 

## User Testing

A point where to start initial user testing, and calibrate the prototype to perfection. 

Based on user feedback, you can go into the MVP with a market-tested UI and UX, and start adding core functionality to your app.
