We accept napkin-sketch or pitch deck ideas and turns them into real storyboards and envision product visualization. We’ll take care of everything for you. (Minimal user research, competitive analysis, user persona, user stories, design, prototyping, branding or landing pages that you may need)



You’ve chosen a market, a segment of the market and a strategic approach 

Possibly collected a list of ideas and hypotheses for solutions and features that you want to experiment with. This is where rapid prototyping starts to play a role — the fast-paced agile test-and-learn environment that we all know and love — but with a structured system that makes the work predictable and extremely efficient.

If you think that your product will take months to design before you can validate --- . If you hold that assumption



“Are these good ideas” and…



In a 1-week XR prototype, you’re not designing or even testing the whole experience at once. Rather you’re focusing on the areas where you have assumptions — the areas where you’re unsure of the results



Why Two Weeks?



Because that’s all the time you need. Any more and you’re spending too much time on perfecting the solution. The idea isn’t to create the most amazing product you can think of — it’s to reduce your risk and create something that people want today.



We lead with customer utility and value — in most cases, form follows function for buyers.





1-Week Tested Prototype: The Process



DESIGN SPRINT

This is the process Google Ventures goes through. Depending on the week and the topic, sometimes I merge Tuesday and Wednesday, then leave 2 days for prototyping instead of one.



Monday: Understand the Problem

Tuesday: Sketch Solutions

Wednesday: Evaluate and Plan

Thursday: Prototype

Friday: Test… then drink.



MVP



MVP… You keep using that word. I do not think it means what you think it means.



This may spark some salty debate, but your MVP is not always the first version of your product. That’s often just… version 1.0. Take it from the father of Lean himself:



\    A Minimum Viable Product is that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort.

\     — Eric Ries, The Lean Startup



It’s a carefully but quickly constructed product that targets the most fundamental and dangerous assumptions on the roadmap. It may not be the product with which you achieve product-to-market fit — sometimes it’s just a platform for getting there
