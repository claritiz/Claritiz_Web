Based on the different phases in a product lifecycle, We help determine  what kind of research to use

* Discovery
* Validation
* Prototyping
* Follow-up

User research can and needs to be done in each of these phases. The exact method, frequency and research design, however, highly depends on which phase the product is currently in.

# Discovery

In this phase, search for a target audience’s problem and its solution. This will form the foundation of the product.

UX research methods for this phase include

* Interview
* Market survey
* Field research
* Competitor analysis and industry research
* Market analysis

If you are looking for a partner to help you validate the real needs or problem, look no further. We can help!

# **Product validation**

In the next phase of the product design process,We validate a solution by Measuring the target audience’s interest for a product/feature idea.        

UX research methods in this phase:

* Landing page tests
* Website analytics
* Fake door tests
* A/B tests

# Product prototyping

 In this phase, Ideas are converted into prototypes. Run several iterations of prototypes at this phase. Usability gets tested extensively.

Changing the prototype and having another round of usability tests costs less than fixing things in a developed software.

UX research methods in this phase:

*    User journey mapping
*    User tests
*    Heatmap analytics
*    Click analytics
*    Card sorting
